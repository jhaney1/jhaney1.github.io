<p> Job 39-10 ,"Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee or abide by the crib?Canst thou Bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?"</p>
<p> Welcome to my website.This website is about the christian view on mythical beasts you see in movives, games, and novels, such as dragons and unicorns. What do you picture when you hear about dragons,the flying beasts, setting fire to towns? How about unicorns,do you see a beautiful horse like animal? If you did your more than likely incorrect .The top image on the right is what I personaly think a unicorn would have looked like in biblical times. The center image is what the most of the world thinks the unicorn looks like.Most people do  not think the unicorn ever existed.Now onto the topic of dragons. The top left image is what most people think a dragon would look like. In fact most people think dragons never existed. The bottom image is what the bible implies a would have dragon looked like in biblical times.  </p>
